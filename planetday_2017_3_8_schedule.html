                        <p> The event will take place at the University of Toronto, Scarborough campus (Room AA160, 
                            Arts & Administrative building - see <a href="http://utsc.utoronto.ca/home/visiting-utsc">map</a>).
                            It will consist of three talks by Prof. Renu Malhotra from the University of Arizona, Prof.
                            David Jewitt from UCLA and Prof. Yanqin Wu from Astronomy at UofT.  Coffee and tea will 
                            be provided throughout the day’s events, with a Wine and Cheese social to follow the
                            final talk.  Transportation will be provided between the St. George and Scarborough
                            Campuses, at multiple times during the day. Note that an extra mid-afternoon trip from
                            UTSC to St. George has been added (see details below).</p>

                                A few points on the dynamical evolution of the young solar system<br>
                                Abstract:<br>
                                <p>The phenomenon of planetesimal-driven giant planet migration in the
                                    early history of our planetary system has become increasingly recognized
                                    as a key process for understanding the overall solar system architecture
                                    and its dynamical evolution.  The dynamical structure of the Kuiper belt
                                    indicates that such migration caused Neptune's orbit to expand outward
                                    from its birth orbit by about 10 AU.  It follows from energy and angular
                                    momentum conservation that a few tens of earth-masses of leftover
                                    planetesimals were ejected from the early solar system, and that Jupiter
                                    migrated inward by a few tenths of an AU.  The orbital distribution of
                                    asteroids near resonances provides independent estimates of Jupiter's and
                                    Saturn's migration.  An initially slow migration of the giant planets may
                                    have been accelerated during a brief but dramatic orbital instability due
                                    to planet-planet resonant encounters. While there is compelling evidence
                                    in the outer solar system for the above scenario, there is also tension
                                    with the observed properties of the inner solar system: the migration of
                                    the giant planets, with or without resonant encounters, would have caused
                                    severe, potentially destabilizing, perturbations on the inner planets’ orbits. 
                                    I will describe these considerations and some ideas for resolving this
                                    crisis in our understanding of the dynamical history of the solar system.</p>

                                Active asteroids<br>
                                Abstract:<br>
                                <p>We have discovered a set of main-belt asteroids distinguished by their
                                    propensity to eject dust, giving them an unexpected comet-like appearance.
                                    While some active asteroids are, indeed, ice-containing bodies in transient
                                    sublimation, activity in others is due to impact, to landslides and even to
                                    complete disintegration of the parent body.  At first just a curiosity, the
                                    active asteroids relate to a number of interesting solar system issues,
                                    including the origin of the oceans, the physics of impact, the physics of
                                    rotational instability, the production of interplanetary dust and the
                                    ultimate fate of the asteroids.</p>

                                The sizes of Kuiper belt objects<br>
                                Abstract:<br>
                                <p>Kuiper Belt Objects are often touted as fossil records of the early Solar
                                    System. So what can we learn from them? Here I will discuss one important
                                    aspect, their primordial size distribution: is it top-heavy with most of
                                    the initial mass absorbed into large bodies like Pluto, or is it bottom-heavy
                                    with most of the mass locked into km-sized boulders and only a minute
                                    fraction running away to form Plutos?</p>

                                <p>These two models assume different conditions in the early Solar system,
                                    rely on different dynamical processes, and make different predictions
                                    for a multitude of observables. These include, e.g., the outward migration
                                    of Neptune, crater counts on Pluto, new comets from the Oort cloud, ...
                                    and, further afield, the looks of extra-solar debris disks.</p>
