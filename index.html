                        <p>Planetary sciences are experiencing a
                            revolution with the discovery of a multitude
                            of planetary systems around other stars. For
                            many years, the distant and less well known
                            outer Solar System represented the main
                            frontier in the exploration of exotic regimes
                            of planetary behaviours. Today, numerous
                            extrasolar planets also offer a chance to
                            explore planetary regimes that had simply not
                            been imagined until the most recent
                            discoveries. </p>

                        <p>The emergence of solid rocky exoplanets (of no more than a few
                            earth masses) around 2009 rapidly made the knowledge of planetary
                            scientists and geoscientists essential to the interpretation of
                            astronomical data about such bodies. This has led to a fertile
                            convergence of ideas between geophysics, planetary science and
                            astronomy, one that is growing stronger as exoplanet data
                            accumulates. Underpinning this exploration of planets near and far is
                            a strong drive to understand our existence on Earth in the greater
                            cosmic context it deserves.</p>


                        <p>Today astronomers are designing observational strategies to find
                            the first traces of life on a remote, Earth-like world. Along the way
                            they are cataloguing the vast diversity of planetary systems found
                            around other stars in order to quantify the frequency of planetary
                            systems like ours. In parallel, planetary scientists are pursuing
                            their search for life in the Solar System, from our planetary
                            neighbour Mars to the distant moons of Saturn and Jupiter.</p>

                        <p>This fertile interdisciplinary opportunity provides the main
                            scientific motivation behind the creation of a cross-departmental,
                            tri-campus Centre for Planetary Sciences at the <a href="http://www.utoronto.ca">University of Toronto</a>.
                            The CPS is hosted at the <a href="http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca">Scarborough campus</a>,
                            within the <a href="http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/physsci/">Department of Physical
                            and Environmental Sciences</a>. The main role of the centre is to provide
                            the best academic forum possible for cross-disciplinary exchanges
                            between faculty, postdoctoral fellows, and students working on planets
                            near and far at the University. To achieve this goal, the centre
                            administers an extensive visitor program and a competitive
                            postdoctoral fellows program. The centre also enhances educational
                            activities by providing an orientation platform for all interested
                            students and by helping attract some of the best undergraduate and
                            graduate talent in planetary science to the University. Finally, the
                            centre supports outreach activities aimed at engaging the general
                            public with Solar system and exoplanet science, with an emphasis on
                            local community efforts.</p>
                        
                        <p>As an interdisciplinary initiative the CPS has strong links with other
                            departments and centres across the University of Toronto, particularly:
                            the <a href="http://www.dunlap.utoronto.ca/">Dunlap Institute</a>,
                            the <a href="http://www.astro.utoronto.ca/">Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics</a>, and

                    <h4>From downtown Toronto</h4>
                    <p>
                        To get to the Scarborough Campus from downtown Toronto take the Bloor (green) subway line Eastbound to the terminus at Kennedy station
                        and then get the 198 UTSC Rocket bus to UTSC.
                    </p>
                    <h4>From Toronto Pearson International Airport</h4>
                    <p>
                        <b>By taxi:</b> A taxi from the airport to UTSC will take 30-45 minutes depending on traffic and will cost $70+tip (taxis from the airport operate on a flat fare based on <a href="https://www.torontopearson.com/uploadedFiles/Pearson/Content/Getting_There/Ground_Transport/Taxi_East_2010.pdf">zones</a>).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>By public transportation:</b> There is unfortunately not an easy way to get to UTSC from the airport on public transportation.  The best option is probably: <br>
                        Take the 192 Airport Rocket to Kipling subway station, then the Bloor (green) subway line to Kennedy station and the 198 UTSC Rocket bus to UTSC.<br>
                        Alternatively one can take the UP Express train to Union station, the Yonge-University (yellow) subway line to York Mills station and the 95E Express bus to Eastbound UTSC,
                        or leave the Yonge-University line at Yonge station to join the Bloor subway line and continue as above.<br>
                        All routes will take around 2 hours.  The UP Express route is $12 more expensive, but is more comfortable.
