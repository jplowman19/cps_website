                    A core activity of the CPS takes the form of planet days, hosted on the University of Toronto's Scarborough campus, in the spirit of day-long academic retreats. During each event, invited and local speakers deliver lectures on selected topics in both planetary and exoplanet science. 
                    Ample time is reserved for questions and comments after the lectures in order to promote discussions of current issues.

                        The Centre for Planetary Sciences at the University of Toronto Scarborough invites you to the first CPS Planet Day of the Year on May 1st. CPS Planet Days are free for everyone to attend, including undergraduate and graduate students. No registration is required. Coffee, breakfast, and lunch are provided free of charge. In addition to four great talks, we will also host a panel discussion on non-academic career paths with representatives from various companies this time. The full program is attached below. All talks will be held in the Council Chamber, Room AA160 at the University of Toronto's Scarborough campus. 
                        </p>
<p>
The CPS also offers a free shuttle service to and from UTSC. Shuttles leave UofT St George at 8:30am and York University at 8:45am and return at the end of the day. We need a head-count for the shuttle service and therefore ask you to sign up for it by sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:hanno.rein@utoronto.ca">hanno.rein@utoronto.ca</a>.

                            After two decades of observation and nearly 4000 exoplanets discovered, we now have a large and very diverse pool of objects to understand inside and outside of our Solar system. To model these planets it is necessary to understand the microphysics of materials under (very) high pressures and (moderately) high temperatures. Ab initio simulations are a great tool to characterize these systems and they enable much more accurate models and thus a deeper understanding of planetary structure and evolution. I will show on the example of different hydrogen-bearing mixtures how the ab initio simulations allow us to better characterize the thermodynamics of giant planets as well as their dynamics. I will also show that the properties of silicates can be precisely determined and provide key information on the habitability of Super-Earths.

                            The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite promises to discover small planets around the nearest and brightest stars. After two months of observations, the TESS mission has recovered a few hundred planetary candidates. In this talk, we present an early look into the TESS data and one of the first discoveries from the TESS mission - the detection of a transiting planet around PI Mensae. The solar-type host star is unusually bright (V=5.7) and was already known to host a Jovian planet in a highly eccentric, 5.7-year orbit. The newly discovered planet has a radius about twice that of Earth and an orbital period of 6.27 days. Using archived radial velocity data, we determined the planet's mass to be about 4.8 ME. Using PI Mensae c as an example, I will review the process of planetary candidate identification in TESS Full Frame Images using the MIT Quick Look Pipeline.

1I/'Oumuamua is the first interstellar interloper to have been detected. Because planetesimal formation and ejection of predominantly icy objects are common by-products of the star and planet formation processes, we address whether 1I/'Oumuamua could be representative of this background population of ejected objects. To do so, we compare the mass density of interstellar objects inferred from its detection to that expected from planetesimal disks under two scenarios: circumstellar disks around single stars and wide binaries, and circumbinary disks around tight binaries. Our study makes use of a detailed study of the PanSTARRS survey volume; takes into account that the contribution from each star to the population of interstellar planetesimals depends on stellar mass, binarity, and planet presence; and explores a wide range of possible size distributions for the ejected planetesimals, based on solar system models and observations of its small-body population. We find that 1I/'Oumuamua is unlikely to be representative of a population of isotropically distributed objects, favoring the scenario that it originated from the planetesimal disk of a young nearby star whose remnants are highly anisotropic. Comparing the fluxes of meteorites and micrometeorites observed on Earth to those inferred from this population of interstellar objects, we conclude that it is unlikely that one of these objects is already part of the collected meteorite samples. The second hypothesis we test is whether 1I/'Oumuamua could be representative of a background population of exo-Oort cloud objects ejected under the effect of post-main sequence mass loss and stellar encounters. We consider the 0.08--8 Msun mass range, take into account the dependencies with stellar mass, Galactocentric distance, and evolutionary state, and consider a wide range of size distributions for the ejected objects. Our conclusion is that 1I/'Oumuamua is likely not representative of this background population, strengthened by the consideration that our estimate is likely an overestimate because it assumes exo-Oort clouds are frequent but the parameter space to form them is actually quite restricted. We discuss whether the number density of free-floating, planetary-mass objects derived from gravitational microlensing surveys could be used as a discriminating measurement regarding 1I/'Oumuamua's origin (given their potential common origin). We conclude that this is challenged by the mass limitation of the surveys and the resulting uncertainty of the mass distribution. The detection of interlopers may be one of the few observational constraints of the low end of the mass distribution of free-floaters, with the caveat that it might not be appropriate to assume they are representative of an isotropic background population, which makes the derivation of a number density very challenging.
